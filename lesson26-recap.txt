The regex method findall() is passed a string, and returns all matches in it, not just the first match.
If the regex has 0 or 1 group, findall() returns a list of strings.
If the regex has 2 or more groups, findall() returns a list of tuples of strings.
\d is a shorthand character class that matches digits. \w matches "word characters" (letters, numbers, and the underscore). \s matches whitespace characters (space, tab, newline).
The uppercase shorthand character classes \D, \W, and \S match charaters that are not digits, word characters, and whitespace.
You can make your own character classes with square brackets: [aeiou]
A ^ caret makes it a negative character class, matching anything not in the brackets: [^aeiou]


Example:

 xmasRegex = re.compile(r'\d+\s\w+') #this will find one digit or more, one space, one word char or more
>>> xmasRegex.findall(lyrics)


vowelRegex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]) will find all a or e or i or u or A.....

doublevowelRegex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]{2}) will find a repetition of vowels

consonantRegex = re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]) will find anything thats not aeiouAEIOU (any character, inclues punc+num digits)
