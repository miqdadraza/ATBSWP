Web pages are plaintext files formatted as HTML.
HTML can be parsed with the BeautifulSoup module.
BeautifulSoup is imported with the name bs4.
Pass the string with the HTML to the bs4.BeautfiulSoup() function to get a Soup object.
The Soup object has a select() method that can be passed a string of the CSS selector for an HTML tag.
You can get a CSS selector string from the browser's developer tools by right-clicking the element and selecting Copy CSS Path.
The select() method will return a list of matching Element objects.


Examples:
>>> import bs4
>>> import requests
>>> res = requests.get("https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd/dp/1593279922/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=automate+the+boring+stuff&qid=1605381661&sr=8-1", headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/49.0.2623.110 Safari/537.36"}) #need all this for reading like a browser
>>> res.raise_for_status()
>>> soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text) #passing html text in bs4

>>> soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser') #passing html text in bs4
